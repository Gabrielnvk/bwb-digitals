# Project Overview

## BWB Digitals React Native Application

### Project Description
A modern React Native application built with Expo, featuring a clean architecture and comprehensive UI component system.

### Key Technologies
- **React Native** with Expo framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **NativeWind** for styling (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **React Native Reusables** component library
- **Jest** for testing

### Current Architecture
The project follows a domain-driven design approach with:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular component architecture
- Shared utilities and hooks
- Type-safe development practices
